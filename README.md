### Hi there 👋

I'm Michal, a data and open-source enthusiast with a background in statistics. I pursued my academic interests at the University of Vienna and Duke University, where I explored statistical analysis and programming.

#### Open source contributions

In my free time, I engage in both independent open-source software development, working on my own projects, and collaborative contributions to existing projects. Notably, I contribute to projects such as [oHMMed](https://github.com/LynetteCaitlin/oHMMed) within the field of population genetics and [AIRSHIP](https://github.com/el-meyer/airship) which focuses on visualizing simulation results in clinical trials. 

I'm dedicated to open source, driven by the belief in the benefits of collaborative development, transparent sharing of knowledge in the software community, and the personal growth that comes with it.

One of the interesting aspects of my journey has been the growing popularity of the [naivebayes](https://github.com/majkamichal/naivebayes) R package I developed, reaching over 300K downloads and being used in the actual high quality [scientific research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41698-022-00322-3). It's rewarding to see it becoming a valuable tool in the R community - particularly for those diving into machine learning - as well as in the scientific community. 

#### I am currently working on...

I am actively engaged in the development of [easyPlot](https://github.com/majkamichal/easyPlot), an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) meticulously designed for [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org). `easyPlot` serves as a powerful tool, allowing users to effortlessly create four fundamental types of graphs — scatterplots, histograms, boxplots, and bar charts — with just a few clicks.

***Key Features and Advantages:***

- **Seamless Data Upload:** `easyPlot` simplifies the data import process by supporting various file formats, including `csv`, `xlsx`, and `txt`. This ensures a seamless experience for users, allowing them to start visualizing their data without unnecessary hurdles.

- **Swift Visualization of Variables:** The tool provides a swift and interactive environment for visualizing different variables within the dataset. Users can quickly explore patterns, trends, and relationships within their data.

- **Multivariate Visualizations:** Harnessing the power of `ggplot2`'s facet grids and aesthetics, `easyPlot` enables users to visualize multiple variables simultaneously on a single graph. This feature enhances the depth of data exploration, allowing users to uncover intricate relationships between multiple dimensions.

- **Flexible Style Experimentation:** `easyPlot` offers a flexible platform for experimenting with the visual style of the generated plots. Users can customize colors, themes, and other visual elements to tailor the appearance of their graphs to suit their preferences.

- **Reproducibility:** One of the standout features of `easyPlot` is its ability to generate reproducible code. The tool automatically generates `R code` corresponding to the created plots, allowing users to reproduce their visualizations easily or integrate them into their R scripts and reports.

**Future Development:**

The development of `easyPlot` is an ongoing process, and I am committed to enhancing its functionality and user experience. User feedback will be incorporated to ensure `easyPlot` remains a valuable asset in the data visualization toolbox.

Take a look at easyPlot and feel welcome to contribute. We're building this tool together to make data visualization more accessible.
