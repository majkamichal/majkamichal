### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michal, a data enthusiast with a background in statistics. I pursued my academic interests at the University of Vienna and Duke University, where I explored statistical analysis and programming.

#### Open source contributions

In my free time, I engage in both independent open-source software development, working on my own projects, and collaborative contributions to existing projects. Notably, I contribute to projects such as [oHMMed](https://github.com/LynetteCaitlin/oHMMed) within the field of population genetics and [AIRSHIP](https://github.com/el-meyer/airship) which focuses on visualizing simulation results in clinical trials. 

I'm dedicated to open source, driven by the belief in the benefits of collaborative development, transparent sharing of knowledge in the software community, and the personal growth that comes with it.

One of the interesting aspects of my journey has been the growing popularity of the [naivebayes](https://github.com/majkamichal/naivebayes) R package I developed, reaching over 300K downloads and being used in the actual high quality [scientific research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41698-022-00322-3). It's rewarding to see it becoming a valuable tool in the R community, particularly for those diving into machine learning.

#### I am currently working on...

I am actively engaged in the development of [easyPlot](https://github.com/majkamichal/easyPlot), an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) designed for [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org). This sophisticated tool empowers users to effortlessly generate four types of graphs â€” scatterplots, histograms, boxplots, and bar chartsâ€”with a few simple clicks. The key advantages of easyPlot include seamless data upload, swift visualization of various dataset variables, flexible style experimentation, and the generation of reproducible code.
